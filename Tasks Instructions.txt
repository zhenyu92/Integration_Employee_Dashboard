Task 1: Create a visualization that provides a breakdown between the male
and female employees working in the company each year, starting from 1990.

Task 2: Compare the number of male managers to the number of female managers
from different departments for each year, starting from 1990.

Task 3: Compare the average salary of female versus male employees in the
entire company until year 2002, and add a filter allowing you to see that
per each department.

Task 4: Create an SQL stored procedure that will allow you to obtain the 
average male and female salary per department within a certain salary range.
Let this range be defined by two values the user can insert when calling the procedure.

Finally, visualize the obtained result-set in Tableau as a double bar chart.
